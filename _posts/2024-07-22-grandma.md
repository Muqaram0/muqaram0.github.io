## HTB - Granny

## Enumeration

### Nmap Scan Results

To start the enumeration, I performed an Nmap scan to discover open ports and services running on the target machine.

### Checking for Supported HTTP Methods

I then checked for supported HTTP methods.

### What is WebDAV?

Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning (WebDAV) is an HTTP extension designed to allow people to create and modify web sites using HTTP. It was originally started in 1996.

### ASP.NET Response Header

On checking the response header, we notice that it is being powered by ASP.NET.

This tells us that we will be able to execute ASPX files on the server.

### Directory Buster Results

I used Dirbuster to find directories and files on the server.

![Dirbuster Results](/assets/img/granny/4.png)

Nothing useful was found.

### Performing DAVTest

I performed a DAVTest to check what files can be uploaded.

## Vulnerabilities

### Reverse Shell Through HTTP Methods

I identified a workaround for a reverse shell through HTTP methods.

## Exploitation

### Using the MOVE Method

We can use the MOVE method, which allows us to rename files. Let's try to upload a file, move it, and rename it to an `.asp` extension to see if that allows us to upload ASP files.

cURL, which stands for client URL, is a command-line tool that developers use to transfer data to and from a server. By default, cURL uses the GET method, but you can use `-X` to change it to other methods like POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.

### Renaming the File

Perfect, now let's try renaming it.

### Creating a Reverse Shell Payload

I used `msfvenom` to create a reverse shell payload which I uploaded to the server as a text file and then renamed it to `.asp`.

### Renaming to ASPX

Renaming the file to `.aspx`.

### Testing the Payload

On curling, I encountered an error.

### Preserving Formatting

To preserve formatting, I used a simple binary command.

### Accessing the Uploaded File

I visited the site to see if the formatting was preserved.

![File Accessed](/assets/img/granny/14.png)

Great, the formatting is preserved.

### Privilege Escalation

Unfortunately, our privilege is still low. Let's try escalating it by checking system info and searching for exploits.

### Writable Directory

Looking for a writable directory on the victim's machine.

### Uploading Files

I uploaded the `churrasco.exe` file and a Netcat listener.

![Uploading Churrasco](/assets/img/granny/22.png)

![Netcat Listener](/assets/img/granny/23.png)

now lets look for a writeable directory on the victims machine

getting our churrasco.exe file

### Setting Up Another Listener

Setting up another Netcat listener.

### Running the Exploit

Running the Netcat listener using churrasco.

![Running Exploit 2](/assets/img/granny/30.png)

We have access now. Let's grab our files.
