# HTB - Nineveh

## Enumeration

### Nmap Scan Results

![Untitled](/assets/img/nineveh/1.png)

### Supported HTTP Methods

![Untitled](/assets/img/nineveh/2.png)

### Dirbusting Results for HTTP

![Untitled](/assets/img/nineveh/3.png)

### Dirbusting Results for HTTPS

*We have to specify -k flag*

### Visiting the Page

## Vulnerabilities

### phpLiteAdmin v1.9 Vulnerability

![Untitled](/assets/img/nineveh/6.png)

## Exploitation

### Brute-Forcing phpLiteAdmin Login Page

![Untitled](/assets/img/nineveh/7.png)

We obtained password `123`. Now let's try accessing and see what's up.

![Untitled](/assets/img/nineveh/8.png)

We are greeted with a page where we can infer that there is a database named `test` with no tables.

### PHP Injection Exploit

### Accessing the Page from Earlier

![Untitled](/assets/img/nineveh/12.png)
![Untitled](/assets/img/nineveh/13.png)

Using Burp Suite, it shows the POST form as this. We assume the password check is hardcoded to be just a simple `strcmp` between two fields. If `strcmp` between two equal strings returns 0, which means it's equal. If we give an invalid type as one of the fields, it will return null, which is comparable to 0. Let's try this approach by modifying the POST data.

And boom, we're in:

### Local File Inclusion (LFI) Check

On visiting the notes page, we see the file is mentioned in the URL. Let's check for LFI.

| notes parameter | Error Message |
| --- | --- |
| ninevehNotes.txt | No error, displays note |
| /etc/passwd | No Note is selected. |
| ../../../../../../../../../../etc/passwd | No Note is selected. |
| ninevehNotes | Warning: include(files/ninevehNotes): failed to open stream: No such file or directory in /var/www/html/department/manage.php on line 31 |
| ninevehNote | No Note is selected. |
| files/ninevehNotes/../../../../../../../../../etc/passwd | File name too long. |
| files/ninevehNotes/../../../../../../../etc/passwd | The contents of /etc/passwd |
| /ninevehNotes/../etc/passwd | The contents of /etc/passwd |

As long as `ninevehNotes` is in the parameter, we can access anything. Let's try to access the shell we created earlier.

### Command Execution Check

Let's check for command execution with `ls`.

![Untitled](/assets/img/nineveh/18.png)

We can execute commands. Let's try getting a reverse shell with Burp Suite now.

#### URL Encoded Reverse Shell Code

Nice, we have access as `www-data`. Now let's escalate our privileges.

## Privilege Escalation

### Upgrading the Shell

### Uploading and Running LinEnum

Let's get [linenum.sh](http://linenum.sh) on an HTTP server and make it available for this machine.

### Exploring the amrois Folder

We can access the `amrois` folder but can't view the flag. Let's look around more.

![Untitled](/assets/img/nineveh/27.png)

`amrois` has access to only this folder.

### Checking for Cron Jobs

Reports are made every minute. There may be a cron job behind this.

Let's try creating our own script.

![Untitled](/assets/img/nineveh/29.png)

```
#!/bin/bash
#loop by line
IFS=$'\n'
old_process=$(ps -eo command)
while true; do
new_process=$(ps -eo command)
diff <(echo "$old_process") <(echo "$new_process") |grep [\<\>]
sleep 1
old_process=$new_process
done
```

Now we do `chmod +x /procmon.sh` followed by `./procmon.sh` to run the script.

### Identifying Vulnerabilities in Chkrootkit

We see that the cron jobs are executing `/usr/bin/chkrootkit`.

Chkrootkit vulnerabilities:

Using the identified vulnerability:

![Untitled](/assets/img/nineveh/33.png)

We have obtained root privilege. Let's grab our flags.

### Flags
