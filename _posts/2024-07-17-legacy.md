## HTB - Legacy

## Overview

Legacy is an easy-tier machine on Hack The Box, providing a good introduction to basic enumeration, vulnerability identification, and exploitation techniques using Metasploit.

## Enumeration

### Nmap Scan Results

To start the enumeration, I performed an Nmap scan to discover open ports and services running on the target machine.

### SMB Vulnerability Check

I then checked for known vulnerabilities in the SMB service running on the machine.
