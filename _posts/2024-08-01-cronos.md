## HTB - Cronos

### Enumeration

#### Nmap Results

We can see that there is DNS-NSID.

Let's perform DNS enumeration with `nslookup`.

#### DNS Enumeration

![Image](/assets/img/cronos/image_1.png)

We will now check for zone transfer using the `DIG` command. DNS zone transfer, also known as DNS query type AXFR, is a process by which a DNS server passes a copy of part of its database to another DNS server. The portion of the database that is replicated is known as a zone.

USAGE: `dig axfr @<DNS_IP> <DOMAIN>`

Let's add these to our hosts file.

![Image](/assets/img/cronos/image_3.png)

cronos and www.cronos

![Image](/assets/img/cronos/image_4.png)

ns1.cronos.htb

admin.cronos.htb

### Vulnerabilities

### Exploitation

![Image](/assets/img/cronos/image_9.png)

Let's try getting past this login screen. We will try some SQL payloads from a cheatsheet.

This one gets us in, and we are greeted with this `welcome.php` page.

![Image](/assets/img/cronos/image_12.png)

![Image](/assets/img/cronos/image_13.png)

Let's try terminating the command and following it up with a basic command.

![Image](/assets/img/cronos/image_14.png)

Okay, it works. Let's try getting a reverse shell.

We got our netcat up.

![Image](/assets/img/cronos/image_15.png)

![Image](/assets/img/cronos/image_16.png)

Okay, this does not work. Let's check the requests that we are sending with Burp Suite and see if we can do anything there.

![Image](/assets/img/cronos/image_17.png)

Okay, so two things are happening:

1. There is some host condition.
2. The code is being URL encoded.

Let's try removing all that while preserving the encoding.

![Image](/assets/img/cronos/image_18.png)

This does not work. Let's try another variation of the netcat command.

![Image](/assets/img/cronos/image_19.png)

This works, and we now have our shell.

![Image](/assets/img/cronos/image_20.png)

![Image](/assets/img/cronos/image_21.png)

And there we have our user flag grabbed right off the bat.

Time to do some privilege escalation for root access.

We go to the `tmp` folder and use `wget` to get `linpeas` from the Python server we started.

![Image](/assets/img/cronos/image_22.png)

Now, let's run `linpeas`.

![Image](/assets/img/cronos/image_23.png)

Oops, I forgot to upgrade the shell. We will do that after this.

![Image](/assets/img/cronos/image_24.png)

![Image](/assets/img/cronos/image_25.png)

There, we upgraded the shell. Now, let's check the `linpeas` result.

![Image](/assets/img/cronos/image_26.png)

Okay, so `pwnkit` seems to be an exploit for this. I have used it before and don't want to use it right now, so let's look a bit more.

![Image](/assets/img/cronos/image_27.png)

Okay, so the orange box tells us that this is 90% a privilege escalation vector, and it probably is because it's a cron job being run with user privileges to create a file with root privileges. We can use this to create our reverse shell for us to get into.

Also, the `*`s at the endâ€”let's put them on a cron decoder thing and see what it means.

[Crontab Guru](https://crontab.guru/V)

![Image](/assets/img/cronos/image_28.png)

With this, we can tell that the job is being run every minute.

Now, let's visit this directory.

![Image](/assets/img/cronos/image_29.png)

In the `artisan` folder, let's put this PHP reverse shell code.

[PHP Reverse Shell](https://github.com/pentestmonkey/php-reverse-shell/blob/master/php-reverse-shell.php)

![Image](/assets/img/cronos/image_30.png)

Change accordingly.

![Image](/assets/img/cronos/image_31.png)

There we go, we have our shell. Now, time to grab our root flag.
