## HTB - Bastard

### Enumeration

#### Nmap Scan Results

#### Homepage

#### Changelog.txt

Default Drupal file

For some reason, DirBuster and Gobuster both seem to be acting up with this box. Let's try DirSearch as a final resort.

#### Vulnerabilities

#### Drupal Vulnerabilities

For Drupal 7.54, we have the following vulnerabilities available

![Image](/assets/img/bastard/image_3.png)

We could go with Drupalgeddon2, but it was released on April 13, 2018, which is much later than the boxâ€™s release date of March 18, 2017.

So let's try looking for an exploit before or nearer to that date.

Had to search just for Drupal this time for a wider list

This is probably the intended exploit, so let's use this.

**Date:** 2017-03-09

### Exploitation

#### Script Changes

Let's make the following changes to the exploit.

Note: Make sure to do `sudo apt install php-curl` before running the script.

That's strange. Oh, I forgot to change the REST endpoint as well. Gobuster gave us the `/rest` directory earlier, and on visiting it, we seem to have activated the endpoint.

Let's modify the script now.

#### Reverse Shell

We got our file `muq.php` uploaded. Now let's try for a reverse shell.

Now time to run the `nc`

And we are in.

### Exploit Usage

Let's try using this exploit.

![Image](/assets/img/bastard/image_16.png)

We will get this on our machine with a Python server and use it to get us a reverse shell.
