## HTB - Grandpa

## Overview

Grandpa is an easy-tier machine on Hack The Box, offering insight into basic enumeration, vulnerability exploitation, and privilege escalation using Metasploit.

## Enumeration

### Nmap Scan Results

To start the enumeration, I performed an Nmap scan to discover open ports and services running on the target machine.

### Homepage

The target's homepage reveals some basic information.

## Vulnerabilities

### Port 80/tcp

The web service running on port 80 was found to be vulnerable. Here's a link to the [exploit](https://www.rapid7.com/db/modules/exploit/windows/iis/iis_webdav_scstoragepathfromurl/).

## Exploitation

### With Metasploit

Using the vulnerability we found earlier, we gained access to the system. Now, let's look around.

Alright, we are unable to access either Harry or Administrator, possibly because our user privilege is low.

### System Information

On trying to get the system information, we encounter this:

### Migrating to NT Authority

Time to migrate into one of the NT Authority services.

### Exploit Suggester

Now, let's run a local exploit suggester and look for exploits for this system.

### Privilege Escalation

Let's go with the client_copy_image exploit, and there we go, we have escalated our privilege.
